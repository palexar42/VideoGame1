=================================================
INSTALLATION:

To install the game you will need to download the engine folder from github and have Mozilla Firefox on your computer

You will also need to download three.js from this website

https://threejs.org/

***Download button will be on the left, under code tab. (click download, not github)
***Three.js download and unzip can sometimes take a while

unzip the two downloads into folders with their respective names

Make a new folder, e.x. VideoGame and put the unzipped folders inside of that folder.


At this point you should have a folder with engine and threejs in it.
Go into engine folder and then right click on cs4143engine0 and open it with Mozilla Firefox to run the game.
